# Portfolio Updater

## Idea 💡
I have a [personal portfolio](https://shreyazz-dev.online/) in which I have severak projects. Adding a new project in the portfolio is a tedious task, so to make it easy and less boring, I made a small web app that let's me add a new project in just one click. 

## Tech Used ⚙️
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS

## Future Updates 🥁
- Only I should be authorized to add new projects to the portfolio, so to do this I'll add a layer of security by adding a username and password login system.
